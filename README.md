# Football-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing football matches using computer vision and machine learning. By leveraging video footage, it automatically tracks player movements, detects key events, and classifies objects such as players, referees, and the ball using YOLO (You Only Look Once). The goal is to provide deeper insights into player performance and match dynamics. The project includes real-time processing, data visualization, and event detection. Future improvements could involve enhancing model accuracy and integrating more advanced deep learning techniques. Feel free to explore and contribute!
